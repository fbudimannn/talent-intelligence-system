# Talent Match Intelligence System 🧠✨

This repository contains the code for the **"Talent Match Intelligence System,"** an end-to-end analytical web application built to transform the internal talent sourcing process.

This application shifts from subjective recruiting to data-driven matching. It dynamically ranks all employees against an "ideal" profile generated in real-time from 1-3 manager-selected benchmark employees. At its core is a weighted **"Success Formula"** derived from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to prioritize candidates based on proven drivers of success (like `Competency`) and de-prioritize statistically insignificant factors (like `Cognitive Scores`).

##  Key Features

* **🤖 AI-Powered Job Profiles:** Integrates with OpenRouter (using Llama 3) to dynamically generate Job Descriptions, Requirements, and Key Competencies from a simple 'Role Purpose' input.
* **⚡ Dynamic Benchmarking:** Ranks *all* employees against an "ideal" profile built in real-time from 1-3 user-selected benchmark employees.
* **📊 Weighted 'Success Formula':** Utilizes a sophisticated 300+ line SQL query to score candidates based on an EDA-validated weighted formula (e.g., Competency: 67.5%, Contextual: 17.5%).
* **📈 Ranked Talent List:** Displays a clear, sortable list of top talent, showing their `final_match_rate` and their "Top TGV" (strongest area).
* **🔍 Candidate Drill-Down:** Allows managers to select any candidate and visualize their TGV profile (Competency, Contextual, etc.) on a radar chart against the benchmark average.
* **💡 Actionable Gap Analysis:** Automatically highlights a candidate's "Strongest Area" and "Largest Gap" to provide a clear starting point for development conversations.

##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Backend & Analysis:** Python
* **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase
* **DB Connection:** SQLAlchemy
* **Visualization:** Plotly, Plotly Express, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **AI (LLM):** OpenRouter (API), OpenAI Library
* **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python (Jupyter Notebook via vscode)
* PostgreSQL (a running database server)
* An OpenRouter Account (to get an API Key)

### 2. Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fbudimannn/talent-intelligence-system.git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For MacOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**
    This project requires your PostgreSQL server to be running and populated with the data (schema and data are not included in this repo).

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` template to create your secret `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the new `.env` file and fill in your credentials:
    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=[your-database-name]
    DB_USER=[your-username]
    DB_PASSWORD=[your-password]
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

6.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run 3_streamlit_app/app.py
    ```

7.  Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser. or `http://192.168.1.9:8501` for network URL


## 🚀 How to Use the App

1.  In the left sidebar, fill in the **Vacancy Details** (Role Name, Job Level, Role Purpose).
2.  From the **"Select up to 3 benchmark employees"** dropdown, pick 1-3 employees who represent your "ideal" profile.
3.  Click the **"✨ Generate Profile & Matches"** button.
4.  Wait a moment for the SQL query and AI call to complete.
5.  Analyze the results:
    * Review the AI-generated **Job Profile**.
    * Examine the **Ranked Talent List** to see the top fits.
    * View the **Dashboard Visualizations** for a macro overview of the talent pool.
    * In the **"Benchmark vs. Candidate Comparison"** section, select a candidate to see their drill-down radar chart and gap analysis.

##  Core Logic: The SQL "Engine"

The heart of this project is `talent_matching_query.sql`. It is not a simple query, but a 6-phase algorithm that runs as a single script:

* **Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Imputation:** Cleans dirty data (e.g., 'inftj', 'nan') and imputes missing values (e.g., `Competency`, `IQ`, `PAPI`) using group-specific medians/modes.
* **Phase 2: Dynamic Benchmark Generation:** Dynamically calculates the "ideal" profile using `MEDIAN` (for numerics) and `MODE` (for categoricals) from the user-selected benchmark employees.
* **Phase 3: Unpivot All Employees:** Transforms the "wide" data for all employees into a "long" format (`employee_id`, `tv_name`, `user_score`) using `UNION ALL`.
* **Phase 4: Scoring:** Compares every employee against the benchmark and creates a `match_score` (0-100) for *every single variable*.
* **Phase 5: Weighting (Success Formula):** Multiplies each variable's `match_score` by its predetermined weight from the "Success Formula".
* **Phase 6: Aggregation & Ranking:** Sums all weighted scores to produce the `final_match_rate` and presents it in a visualization-ready format.
